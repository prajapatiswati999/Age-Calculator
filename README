# Age Calculator 
 
The Age Calculator is a smart web application designed to accurately compute a user's age based on their date of birth. This project utilizes Python for backend processing, HTML for structuring the web interface, and CSS for styling, providing a user-friendly experience. 
 
## Overview 
 
The Age Calculator application is structured as a simple web application with a Python backend. It uses Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework, to handle HTTP requests and routing. The frontend consists of an HTML form that allows users to input their date of birth. The application processes this input to calculate the age and returns the result to the user. Currently, the project includes the following files: 
 
- `app.py`: A Flask application that sets up a server listening on port 5001. It includes a route ('/') that supports both GET and POST methods, rendering an HTML template and logging the date of birth input from the user. 
- `templates/index.html`: An HTML file that provides the user interface for the Age Calculator. It contains a form where users can input their date of birth and submit it to calculate their age. 
 
## Features 
 
- **User Input**: Users can enter their date of birth through a simple HTML form. 
- **Age Calculation**: The backend processes the date of birth input to calculate the user's age. 
- **Logging**: Basic logging is set up to record the date of birth received from the user. 
 
## Getting started 
 
### Requirements 
 
To run the Age Calculator application, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:
